# TapTapTap
TapTapTap is a game that measures your tapping speed and records your highscores. Uses [TapTapTap Server](https://github.com/TheLKL321/tap-tap-tap-server) for global highscore keeping.

### About the project
It was made as an excercise, and never meant to be played for serious. It can be used as an example of:
- simple MVVM pattern
- basic RecyclerView
- SharedPreferences
- AlertDialog
- CountDownTimer
- Object to String serialization
