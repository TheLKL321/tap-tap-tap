# TapTapTap
TapTapTap is a game that measures your tapping speed and records your highscores.

### About the project
It was made as an excercise, and never meant to be played for serious. It can be used as an example of:
- basic RecyclerView
- SharedPreferences
- AlertDialog
- CountDownTimer
- Object to String serialization
